# FunChain Project

**1. Custom Blockchain Platform Development**

- **Design and implement core blockchain components**
  * Create block structure with headers containing timestamp, previous block hash, and merkle root
  * Implement chain management to maintain block sequence and handle forks
  * Design transaction structure to store project proposals, votes, and fund allocations
  * Create merkle tree implementation for efficient transaction verification

- **Develop consortium-specific consensus mechanism**
  * Implement a custom consensus algorithm based on:
    - Number of times a member has reviewed projects
    - Votes received for reports on specific projects
    - Percentage of funding request a member is willing to contribute
  * Define validator node selection based on these criteria
  * Set up block validation rules incorporating these factors
  * Implement voting mechanism for consensus among validator nodes
  * Define block finality conditions

- **Create network protocol and P2P communication**
  * Develop node discovery mechanism to find and connect to other consortium nodes

  * Create transaction broadcasting system
  * Design peer management system to maintain node connections
  * Implement network synchronization protocol for new nodes

- **Implement transaction management system**
  * Create transaction pool (mempool) to store pending transactions
  * Implement transaction validation rules
  * Design transaction prioritization mechanism
  * Create transaction signing and verification system
  * Implement double-spending prevention

- **Build state management system**
  * Design world state database to track current state of all accounts and projects
  * Implement state transitions for project status changes
  * Create state verification system
  * Implement state synchronization across nodes
  * Design state rollback mechanism for handling forks

- **Design storage layer**
  * Implement block storage system
  * Create transaction history database
  * Design index management for quick data retrieval
  * Implement chain metadata storage
  * Create pruning mechanism for old data

- **Create node software**
  * Develop node initialization and startup procedures
  * Implement node configuration management
  * Create node monitoring and health check system
  * Design node backup and recovery procedures
  * Implement node update mechanism

- **Develop blockchain API interfaces**
  * Create RPC interfaces for blockchain interaction
  * Implement WebSocket endpoints for real-time updates
  * Design REST APIs for external system integration
  * Create SDK for easy blockchain interaction
  * Implement authentication and authorization for API access
